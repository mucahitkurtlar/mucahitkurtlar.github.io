I\u0026rsquo;m moving my blog to Hugo. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Jekyll for a while, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to try out Hugo (not the trol one) for a while now. I\u0026rsquo;m using GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions for deployment. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Jekyll, GitHub automaticly builds your site for you, but with Hugo you have to do it yourself using GitHub Actions. So I\u0026rsquo;ve tested Hugo to see if it\u0026rsquo;s worth the effort. And it is!\nHugo is just so easy to use, customize and deploy. Of course, it\u0026rsquo;s written in Go :)\nWith Hugo you can use Go templates to create your own themes or use one of the many themes that are available on Hugo Themes. I\u0026rsquo;ve used the Blowfish theme for this site. It\u0026rsquo;s a very nice, minimalist theme and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to customize. I\u0026rsquo;ve also added a few customizations of my own. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll write my own theme in the future.\n","date":"6 October 2022","permalink":"/posts/moving-to-hugo/","section":"Posts","summary":"Hi there! I\u0026rsquo;m moving my blog to Hugo.
