Currently working on back-end development with Node.js and Go. I am not a fanatical fan of any of these languages, but I prefer Go if I have to choose. I have a lot of experience with some other languages like Python, C, Java, PHP etc. I also have experience with some frameworks/libraries like Gorilla, Fiber, Nest, Django, Flask, EF etc. I have a lot of experience with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis etc. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to list all of them :) I will write more about my tools and technologies.\nCyber Security # Cyber security is a very interesting field for me. I\u0026rsquo;m interested in both offensive and defensive side of cyber security. I have no proffesional experience in cyber security and it\u0026rsquo;s just a hobby for me but I\u0026rsquo;m trying to learn as much as I can. I\u0026rsquo;m currently learning about mobile web application security and I\u0026rsquo;m planning to learn about reverse engineering. I\u0026rsquo;m also member of Ankara University Cyber Security Club . We share our knowledge about cyber security and we organize workshops and participate in CTFs. You can find our CTFtime profile here .\nEmbedded # I\u0026rsquo;m very interested in this field because I like compiled languages. Especially C and C++. I\u0026rsquo;m planning to learn about programming Rust for embedded systems. I\u0026rsquo;m also interested in microcontrollers like Arduino (AVR) and Raspberry Pi (ARM). I wrote some simple libraries for Raspberry Pi Pico. You can find one of them here . Also I have commited some code to Raspberry Pi Pico SDK examples .\nFOSS # I really love open source software. I\u0026rsquo;m using GNU/Linux as my main operating system. I\u0026rsquo;m also using some open source software like Firefox, LibreOffice, GIMP, Tutanota etc. I make some contributions to open source projects as well. I use Arch btw :)\nTools and Technologies # Here is a section for recruiters and HRs. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to list all of my tools and technologies here. I\u0026rsquo;m just going to list some of them. If I have a open source project that uses a specific tool or technology, I will mention it in the list.\nGeneral # Arch GNU/Linux + KDE Plasma Debian GNU/Linux Alpine GNU/Linux CentOS Git Docker Docker Compose VS Code vim GNU Make CMake zsh/bash GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps Trello Postman, Hoppscotch Figma, Penpot Back-end # Node.js Express Nest Go Fiber ( limoni ) Gorilla ( gollery , Go-Shopping ) Echo GORM Gin Python Django Flask ( Spotify-Python-API ) C socket ( suricat ) Java Spring JAX-RS C# ASP.NET Core ( BLM4531-Final ) Entity Framework Rust Rocket ( suricat ) PHP :( Front-end # React Vue Sass Databases # MongoDB MySQL/MariaDB PostgreSQL Redis Microsoft SQL Server Cyber Security # Burp Suite Genymotion JADX Frida MobSF Metasploit Nmap RustScan SQLMap Wireshark Nessus Embedded # C AVR ( Watchdog-Telegram-Bot , pyrotechnic-controller , room-thermostat ) ARM ( suricat ) Computer Graphics # Vulkan ( lard ) SDL2 ( NiceYet-Engine ) ","date":"16 October 2022","permalink":"/about/","section":"MÃ¼cahit's Blog","summary":"Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹ # I\u0026rsquo;m a 4th year computer engineering student at Ankara University and interesed in cyber security, embedded, back-end, FOSS.

I\u0026rsquo;m moving my blog to Hugo. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Jekyll for a while, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to try out Hugo (not the trol one) for a while now. I\u0026rsquo;m using GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions for deployment. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Jekyll, GitHub automaticly builds your site for you, but with Hugo you have to do it yourself using GitHub Actions. So I\u0026rsquo;ve tested Hugo to see if it\u0026rsquo;s worth the effort. And it is!\nHugo is just so easy to use, customize and deploy. Of course, it\u0026rsquo;s written in Go :)\nWith Hugo you can use Go templates to create your own themes or use one of the many themes that are available on Hugo Themes . I\u0026rsquo;ve used the Blowfish theme for this site. It\u0026rsquo;s a very nice, minimalist theme and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to customize. I\u0026rsquo;ve also added a few customizations of my own. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll write my own theme in the future.\n","date":"6 October 2022","permalink":"/posts/moving-to-hugo/","section":"Posts","summary":"Hi there! I\u0026rsquo;m moving my blog to Hugo.
