# Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 4th year computer engineering student at Ankara University and interesed in cyber security, embedded, back-end, FOSS.
<br>
And I can proudly say that I'm a GNU/Linux enthusiast :)
<br>
<br>
If you found one of my messy repos useful and want to donate some monero...

## So... Here's my interests:

### Back-end

This topic constitutes a large part of my knowledge base. Currently working on back-end development with Node.js and Go. I am not a fanatical fan of any of these languages, but I prefer Go if I have to choose. I have a lot of experience with some other languages like Python, C, Java, PHP etc. I also have experience with some frameworks/libraries like Gorilla, Fiber, Nest, Django, Flask, EF etc. I have a lot of experience with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis etc. Don't worry, I'm not going to list all of them :) I will write more about my tools and technologies.

### Cyber Security

Cyber security is a very interesting field for me. I'm interested in both offensive and defensive side of cyber security. I have no proffesional experience in cyber security and it's just a hobby for me but I'm trying to learn as much as I can. I'm currently learning about mobile web application security and I'm planning to learn about reverse engineering. I'm also member of [Ankara University Cyber Security Club](https://www.aucyberclub.org/). We share our knowledge about cyber security and we organize workshops and participate in CTFs. You can find our CTFtime profile [here](https://ctftime.org/team/32148).

### Embedded

I'm very interested in this field because I like compiled languages. Especially C and C++. I'm planning to learn about programming Rust for embedded systems. I'm also interested in microcontrollers like Arduino (AVR) and Raspberry Pi (ARM). I wrote some simple libraries for Raspberry Pi Pico. You can find one of them [here](https://github.com/mucahitkurtlar/Pico-74HC595). Also I have commited some code to [Raspberry Pi Pico SDK examples](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples).


### FOSS

I really love open source software. I'm using GNU/Linux as my main operating system. I'm also using some open source software like Firefox, LibreOffice, GIMP, Tutanota etc. I make some contributions to open source projects as well. [I use Arch btw](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/btw-i-use-arch) :)


## Tools and Technologies
